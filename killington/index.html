	<p><h2><u>Spartan Race Ultra - Killington, Vermont </u></h2> </p>
		<p> 30.5 miles, 14k elevation, 13:05 hours. 34% completion rate.</p>

<p><u>Introduction</u></p>
<p>
	This narrative summarizes my solo trip to Killington, Vermont 09.10.21 - 09.12.21.
	For one year (2020) I enjoyed normalcy in my New York City apartment.
	This solo trip I wanted to overcome adversity. 
	I believe this helps me be appreciative and thankful for everyday normality. 
</p>


 <p><u> Training </u> </p>
 <p>
	I lived in Herald Towers which is a 26th storey luxury building in midtown Manhattan. 
	My training included: stair climbers in the fire exit (24-story), four to six times; 
	ruck PT using my weighted rucksack; apartment gym; 
	running with Orchard Street Runners and Old Man Run Club. I trained four to five times a week.

<p>
	Solo trip. For two nights, I stayed in my rental car (Toyota Camry 
	2019) at a campsite. On Friday night, 
	I slept in the cold, and felt like I froze death. My space 
	blanket was no better than a one hundred gallon trash bag. On Saturday night,
	my body was destroyed so I felt nothing. 
	Mcdonalds was my safe haven. I chose Mcdonalds because it offered: free wifi, bathrooms, 
	and convenient hours. Starbucks, and other competing fast 
	food locations more or less offer the same, but Mcdonalds 
	has extended hours. The Mcdonalds
	was open 5am - 12am which was almost 24/7. If you are wondering how I showered.
	I didn't. I relied on wet wipes and I used the water hose at the Spartan Race venue.
</p>

<p>
	I led the 
	last Ultra wave heat 07:00am. I went hard. I passed Age Group & Open racers who started in
	the earlier heats (06:45am, 06:30am, 06:15am & 06:00am heat)
	This course featured extended up hill segments & steep downhills.
	Flat sections were a rarity. I ran through every flat segment, and some of the downhills.
</p>

<p>
	I never stopped moving. For thirteen hours straight, I was 
	in constant motion ascending up and descending down the mountain. When I reached 
	the water obstacles, my body needed the  
	the cold water. The cold lake water numbed the pain, and
	helped recalibrate my muscles and erased my fatigue. (I used 
	to dread cold water during events, but now I learned to endure & appreciate it. This was 
	an evolution).  
</p>

<p>
	Mile three featured the famous Death March; mile 
	five was the ultra loop (Death March II). Neither of 
	these were as difficult compared to mile twelve to mile thirteen. I’m going to 
	reference mile twelve - mile thirteen as the "Angry March" because this 
	section was where a lot of racers got destroyed. Throughout the race,
	there were always racers positioned on the 
	sideline, breathing heavily, and staring into the distant 
	void. However during the Angry March, the congestion was highest.
	The Angry March was the steepest segment.
	During my ascent, I had to toggle 
	between bear crawl and hiking in order to move forward.
	My morale was low. I learned from past endurance events 
	that when the situation get bad, it is time to
	dial up the intensity and get angry. 
	Rarely, do I let my anger and ferocity surface but in these 
	situations, I go all out. (I was 
	angry during the first Angry March. However I was in a violent 
	frenzy & rage during the second lap. The 
	sandbag carry that followed after this was 
	the fastest sandbag carry I ever did). 
 </p>


<p>I hit transition at 1:45pm. The cut off for transition 
	is 2:00pm. You have to exit the transition area by 2:00pm
	otherwise you get disqualified.
	At transition it was strict grab and go; grab Gatorade, 
	protein bars & gels; drink ¾ of my gallon of water; leave. I 
	spent about fifty seconds in the transition area, 
	and then started my second lap.</p>

<p>
	During the second lap, I was more observant. 
	I noticed some Ultra & Beast 
	racers inadvertently avoided running & walking through 
	the mud. They preferred to take the "clean" route with the 
	least amount of water & mud. Instead of taking sharp turns, 
	and cutting corners, they would take this longer
	path. Unlike them, I did not give a fuck. I narrowed
	the gap, and took the most optimal path 
	even if I had to step through a foot of mud. Mud, 
	dirt, sand, and water did not even phase me. I even coated 
	my face and body in it because my muscles were fatigued
	and the cool feeling helped alleviate the lactic acid build up. During 
	these congested and narrow segments in the woods, my "I don't give a fuck" strategy 
	allowed me to manuever around and pass a lot of racers. I needed to do
	this in order to make the next time cut off.
</p>

<p>
	Around mile twenty one one I hit the “endurance wall”. The left side of my face 
	went numb, my chest was vibrating, 
	and my heartrate was high. I believe these are symptoms of hyponatremia, 
	low blood sugar, and dehydration.
	Rarely do I succumb 
	to the internal dialogue between my brain and body, 
	but this time I almost conceived. The Gatorade bottle, that I carried
	during my second lap, was my lifeline.
	When your body is starving for nutrition, nutrition hits differently.
	Any caloric intake correlates to a direct energy 
	boost. (Nutrition, Nutrition, Nutrition. Bring a feast, 
	because you are going to need it. For this race, expect 
	to consume calories every 45 minutes. Do you need a camelbak?
	I did not have a camelbak or water reservoir on me during 
	the race, therefore I was dependent on the water stations. 
	There were 19 water stations, and I drank 
	16-24 oz of water at every station.) 
	</p>

<p>
	My mantra during the race was: “The only way I will 
	stop is if they pull me off the course, otherwise I'm 
	not stopping”. For me to reflect on this event peacefully,
	I can only acept two outcomes:
	"medical or performance dropped by event official"; "Finisher". I finished at 08:05pm.
</p>

<p>
	Final thoughts. This race was exactly what I was looking for.
	I wanted to be humbled and I wanted to push my mind, body, and heart to a new limit. 
	I can state with full confidence that my tenacity, grit, and perseverance 
	were pushed to a new level. Spartan Race Ultra - Killington, Vermont delivered.
