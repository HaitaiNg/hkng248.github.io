	<p><h2><u>My Second Triathalon </u></h2> </p>
		<p>07.24.22 : This is the a quick summary of how I trained and how the Lake Placid Ironman went down. </p>

 <p>SWIM: I was able to squeeze in one month of dedicated swim training. I flew back to MI December 2022, and trained at a high school pool every day for a month. The training was sufficient for the race. During the race, the blue sky to Lake Placid water context switching made me dizzy. I found relief by swimming with my eyes closed. I would do sighting every 20-30 seconds. (Its important to be cautious of your heart rate in open water). My estimated finishing time (1.5) hours was in alignment with my actual finishing time (1.58). </p>

 <p>BIKE: I did not have a consistent training regime for the bike lol.
	The day before the race I got my bike rental. I re-learned how to shift gears in order to respond to Lake Placid's hilly inclines, how to avoid cross chaining and how to ride. During the race my bike chain fell off twice, and I learned how fix it on the course.</p>

<p>RUN: I run 3-4 times a week and try to dial out 18-24 miles a week. I run on the major NYC bridges, west side high way, Central Park, and the streets. I run with Orchard Street Runners on Tuesday. 
	Since the run has the least amount of variables or dependencies that could go wrong, I went all out. The run was a jog; walk; run; jog; walk; eat. I did this pattern for 26.2 miles. My body was still responding to the two previous endeavors. I could barely hold my usual run pace without my heart rate feeling like it was a zone 4 & zone 5</p>

<p>Race Nutrition: The aid stations are sick. It’s an endurance athlete’s dream. Everything listed below was available and provided by Ironman. (They provided a lot of other nutrition, but I did not try those because I wanted to stick with nutrition I'm familiar with)</p>

<p>Liquids: 1 water; 1 gatorade endurance; 1 water; 1 gatorade endurance; shots of  Coca-Cola and Red Bull because I started falling asleep.</p>

<p>Gels and solid foods: 5 Maurten gels (non caffeinated); 2 Maurten gels (caffeinated); 3 bananas; cookies; pretzels & chicken broth (This was the best chicken broth I ever had). </p>

<p>Overall this entire event was a “whatever fuck it, I’m going to just do it”.</p>
